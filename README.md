# Thoughts
I find the article compelling and interesting because it stresses the importance of the software aspect more than people 
believe to be. It suggests that we have relied on hardware advancement to automatically boost our program so we traded 
program time for development time. As Moore's Law stopped taking effect, we the programmers have to actually craft our 
codes in ways that is optimal. Many of us do not optimize all the processors or take consideration of hardware when 
wriitng our codes so alot of performance is lost. I find it odd that this form of programming is not even taught at 
schools as it seems to be the trend of future programming as sequential programming becomes more obsolete.
